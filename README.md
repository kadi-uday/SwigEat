# 🍔 SwigEat - A Swiggy Clone

SwigEat is a fully responsive food delivery web app inspired by Swiggy. This project showcases my understanding of core React principles, Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for design, and real-world API integration. The app allows users to browse restaurants, view dynamic menus, manage a shopping cart, and experience a clean UI optimized for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's sm, md, lg breakpoints.
- **Restaurant Listings** – Browse restaurants fetched from Swiggy's API.
- **Menu Display** – View detailed menus for selected restaurants.
- **Cart Functionality** – Add and Clear Cart items.
- **Real-time API Integration** – Fetches restaurant data dynamically based on locality.
- **Search Functionality** – Search restaurants by name.
- **Shimmer Loading UI** – Loading animation for better UX.
- **Routing** – Seamless navigation between pages with React Router.
- **Testing** – Unit tests and Integration tests are written with Jest & React Testing Library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** – Functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Redux + Redux Toolkit** – For global state management (cart)
- **Tailwind CSS** – For responsive, utility-first styling
- **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing
- **Jest** – Unit Testing and Integration Testing.
- **Swiggy Public API** – Mock or live restaurant data fetching
